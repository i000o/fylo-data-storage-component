## Overview.

This is a HTML & CSS only component. It's the first of the Junior components I've tried without JS implementation.

## Goal.

My goal here is to refresh my knowledge of layouts some more and regain some confidence styling pages quickly. I've opted to use Sass over Tailwind here, namely due to my familiarity with Sass. Once I feel confident again with simple component styling, I'll use Tailwind there or commit refactors.

## Lessons

1. `background:` shorthand - values are sensitive to order - `background-size` and `background-position`.
2. Getting better at flexboxes within flexboxes now. My understanding `flex-basis` in relation to `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` could use some work.
3. Desktop was way harder. Is this a Grid?
4. 4K screens - The background cuts off on either right and left sides. I'm not sure why. Up to 1440px, it seems ok.
5. Broken responsiveness on the `185GB left` element. I positioned relative to other elements, but when viewport is scaled up, it strays too far away from its anchor and then snaps back. Not a good look! This is what made me think this is a possible Grid on desktop that I didn't pick up on.

## Reflections

- I completed the mobile styles in 1 hour.
